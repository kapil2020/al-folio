I am **Kapil Meena**, a PhD scholar at the Ranbir and Chitra Gupta School of Infrastructure Design and Management, **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**, India. My research focuses on the intersection of **travel behaviour**, **air quality**, and **sustainable urban mobility**.

I hold a Master of Technology in Transportation Engineering from **IIT Roorkee**, and a Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering from **Rajasthan Technical University**. Over the years, I have contributed to numerous projects and publications that examine how environmental awareness shapes mobility patterns in urban India.

My academic journey is also enriched by collaborative projects with organizations like the **World Resources Institute (WRI), India**, and hands-on experience with tools such as Python, R, Tableau, QGIS, and SPSS. I actively contribute as a reviewer to Q1 journals and serve in conference organizing roles, including the **Annual Conference on Infrastructure and Built Environment (IBSR)**.

I am passionate about developing data-driven solutions for sustainable transport and equitable exposure mitigation.
