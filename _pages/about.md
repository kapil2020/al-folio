I am a PhD scholar at the [**Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), affiliated with the [**MUST Lab**](https://www.mustlab.in/), where we work on building data-driven solutions for sustainable urban mobility.

I hold a Masterâ€™s (MTech) degree from [**IIT Roorkee**](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), and my academic journey lies at the intersection of **transportation systems**, **urban livability**, and **environmental sustainability**.

My research primarily investigates:
- **Urban air quality and human exposure to pollution**
- **Road transport emissions modeling**
- **Activity-travel behavior** and its environmental impact
- **Gender differences in travel behavior and health outcomes**

At MUST Lab, we aim to develop transport infrastructure professionals equipped to tackle emerging challenges at the nexus of transport, health, and environment.

In addition, I actively apply **machine learning** and **data analytics** in transportation to promote informed policy and sustainable mobility solutions.
